<h2 id='about'>About</h2>

<p>Finish Him! is a smart and quick word completion (expansion) plugin similar to Textmate&#8217;s or Netbeans word completion. It will complete the current word based on matches in the current and other visible buffers.</p>

<h2 id='how_it_works'>How it works?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s main differences with standard JEdit&#8217;s &#8220;Complete Word&#8221; action are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>it doesn&#8217;t show popup with completion options. If there are multiple matches, you can cycle through these by pressing Finish Him! keyboard shortcut continuously - hitting keyboard shortcut few times is much faster than locating the word in popup list</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>suggested words are sorted by distance from the caret according to these rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>first, words from current buffer found before caret, nearest words first;</li>

<li>then words from current buffer found after caret, nearest words first;</li>

<li>then all words from other visible buffers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='requirements'>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>JDK 1.5</li>

<li>JEdit 4.3pre17+</li>

<li>Scala Plugin 1.1.0</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='configuration'>Configuration</h2>

<p>This plugin currently doesn&#8217;t have any configuration options, it just doesn&#8217;t need any right now. However I suggest to add a shortcut key to Finish Him! completion action in jEdit Options Pane. Personaly I use ESC key for it (like default Textmate&#8217;s shortcut for word completion).</p>
